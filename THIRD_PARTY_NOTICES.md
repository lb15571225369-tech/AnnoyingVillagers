## Third-Party Notices - AnnoyingVillagers

This repository contains a mix of original work and third-party materials.

### Default rule
Files not listed here (and not marked with an SPDX header for a third-party license) are treated as **Original Materials**
and are licensed under **AV-RO-1.0** (see `LICENSE`).

### Rule for third-party materials
If a file or path is listed below, the **upstream license applies** to that file/path (or the described portions).
All required upstream notices must be preserved.

> Tip: Prefer listing **exact file paths**. Use folders only when every file inside shares the same upstream license.
